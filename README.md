# AdSection
Magento module that allows you to add custom banner sections in any XML-layout block. It's manageable by Admin panel - which allows you to define sections (for example "Category page banner") and then assign specified banners to this sections.

Works like simple banner rotaror. Developer could place **DivanteCommon_AdSection_Block_Section_Slider** block into layouts where blocks should be displayed.
